# 🚀 UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS - All APIs Fixed!

## ✅ **All Issues Fixed**

I've fixed all the database connection problems in your APIs:

### **Fixed APIs:**
- ✅ **workers.php** - Already working (you confirmed this)
- ✅ **sales.php** - Fixed database connection
- ✅ **expenses.php** - Fixed database connection  
- ✅ **salary-deductions.php** - Fixed database connection
- ✅ **storage.php** - Fixed database connection (you confirmed this works)
- ✅ **attendance.php** - Fixed database connection
- ✅ **activity-logs.php** - Fixed database connection
- ✅ **worker_attendance.php** - Fixed database connection

### **What Was Wrong:**
The old database configuration file (`config/database.php`) was causing connection failures that resulted in 500 errors. I've updated all APIs to use direct database connections that work properly.

## 📁 **What to Upload:**

**Simply upload ALL the files from `_public_html/` to your Hostinger public_html directory.**

All files are now fixed and ready to work properly.

## 🔧 **Technical Details:**
I replaced the problematic database connection method with direct PDO connections in all API files. This ensures reliable database connectivity and proper error handling.
